                    My name is Logan. I have been a software developer for the last 7 years and started my career as a tester.
                    I believe having started as a tester I have brought along with me the skills and mindset needed to ensure
                    my code is efficient and has been tested to the extreme. My goal as a software developer is to create clean 
                    modern looking systems that run fast and efficiently for the best user experience possible.

                    but was mainly focused around integrating different systems to 
                    work with a central software platform.

                    My main achievement while working at toob was the initial setup 
                    of an ACS system and integration of the ACS API into the core 
                    network management software allowing the remote management of 
                    CPE giving the support staff the ability to setup, manage and 
                    diagnose issues for customers all in one location.

                    At SupplyPoint I worked on 2 main projects. The first project 
                    was the development of a REST API to enable the sharing of 
                    information from a central system to other smaller pieces of 
                    software allowing for a central store of information.

                    The second project was the development of the UI for industrial
                    vending machines using ReactJS. This development was to replace 
                    an outdated UI in order to give customers more power over the 
                    appearance of their machines

                    to test the software being developed and to create automated tests 
                    to help ensure the software is tested consistently.

                    Alongside my role as the tester I also helped to maintain the 
                    windows servers used for testing and development and the databases 
                    for each system to ensure that all the servers were running the same
